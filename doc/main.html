9. Intellectual Property & Confidentiality Policy

9.1. Patent Policy

Engineering Documents may include technology that is subject to Essential Claims (see
section 9.1.2) but only if all known patent holders are prepared to agree to terms that are
“Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory” (RAND) for all Essential Claims. All Engineering
Committees and Groups, as described in section 3, are entitled to give preference to
technologies that are believed to be free of Essential Claims or for which a free-of-charge
license will be available, provided any such solution is believed to be technically adequate. A
Committee shall not discuss or otherwise consider specific licensing terms for such
technologies.

It is important that, whenever possible, Committees are able to make a choice of technology
based on all relevant information, including the existence, or potential existence, of any
Essential Claims that may encumber a technology under consideration.

This Policy imposes an obligation on all Committee Participant Members and Observer
Members (Members) and Guests, in accordance with section 9.1.4, to notify the Technology
Committee Chair, as early as possible in the development process if they are aware, based
on their actual personal knowledge, of patents or patent applications, anywhere in the world,
that might contain Essential Claims to a technology being proposed for inclusion in an
Engineering Document.

9.1.1. Notice to Meetings

At the start of each meeting the Chair shall read a statement in a form approved by the
Standards Committee reminding Members and Guests of the obligations imposed by this
Policy.

9.1.2. Essential Claims

An Essential Claim is “essential” to an Engineering Document only if it is necessarily infringed
by implementing the Normative Text of that Engineering Document and is “necessarily
infringed” only when there is no commercially-reasonable non-infringing alternative for
implementing the Engineering Document. Essential Claims to an Engineering Document
exclude those essential to enabling technologies, which are those technologies that may be
necessary to make or use any implementations but are not expressly set forth in the
Engineering Document. Essential Claims to an Engineering Document also exclude claims
essential to any Normative Reference included in the Engineering Document.

9.1.3. Patent Statement to Accompany Engineering Document Submission from
External Organizations

A completed SMPTE Patent Statement is required when a draft new Engineering Document
is submitted to SMPTE on behalf of a company or other outside organization. The Patent
Statement shall be made by the company or organization using the form approved by the
Standards Committee and shall include the information required on that form.

A Technology Committee may agree by Administrative Vote to consider a draft document, or
contribution to a draft document, without a Patent Statement, provided assurance is received
from the submitter that the Patent Statement will be provided within 45 days. If no Patent
Statement is received within 45 days of the submission, the Technology Committee Chair
shall inform the Standards Vice President, who may suspend work on the submission. 

A Member or Guest making any contribution to the Normative Text of a proposed Engineering
Document shall provide any declaration required under Section 9.1.4.

9.1.4. Declaration of Knowledge of Relevant Intellectual Property

This Policy imposes an obligation on all Members and Guests to notify the Technology
Committee Chair, as early as possible in the development process, if they are aware, based
on their actual personal knowledge, of patents or patent applications that might contain
Essential Claims to a technology being proposed for inclusion in an Engineering Document.

The requirement to notify the Technology Committee Chair of actual personal knowledge of
actual or potential Essential Claims is an ongoing obligation that begins with becoming a
Participant Member or Observer Member of a Technology Committee, or attending a meeting
as a Guest, and continues through any form of participation in the work or proceedings of the
Technology Committee, including any form of participation by electronic means such as
receipt of emails. Any required notice shall be given as soon as practically possible and in all
cases shall be given within 45 days after the knowledge is obtained and in advance of any
vote on the Engineering Document. The notice shall be either in the form of a verbal
statement at a meeting, which shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting, or in written
form to the Chair of the responsible Technology Committee. The notice shall include all
relevant information available to the Member or Guest, such as patent or application
number(s) and owner of the intellectual property, and shall identify the part(s) of the
Engineering Document believed to be subject to Essential Claims.

The receipt of such a notice shall create a Technology Committee action item for the Director
of Engineering, who shall follow the procedures of section 9.1.5 to solicit a Patent Statement
from the reported owner of the intellectual property.

This Policy does not require any patent search and specifically recognizes that sponsorship
of a Member or Guest does not create any obligation to perform a patent search.

This Policy recognizes that all Members and Guests act as individuals and that obligations
imposed by this Operations Manual apply to the Member or Guest rather than to any
sponsoring organization. For this reason, the obligation to disclose is created by the actual
personal knowledge of the Member or Guest and applies to any potential Essential Claims
known to the Member or Guest, whether or not the patent or patent application is owned by a
sponsor. Nothing in this Policy shall impute knowledge of a Member or Guest by reason of
employment, sponsorship, or any other association or connection with a patent applicant or
holder.

This Policy does not require a Member or Guest to form a legal opinion as to the applicability
or enforceability of Essential Claims, but does require a disclosure if the Member or Guest
has actual personal knowledge of a patent or patent application that, in the good faith
judgment of the Member or Guest, is likely to include Essential Claims to implementation of
the proposed Engineering Document.

It is recognized that, on occasion, this obligation may conflict with terms of employment or
contractual agreements. Members and Guests shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
clearance to declare any relevant Essential Claims. No Member may support the adoption of
an Engineering Document or technology while knowing or believing that undeclared Essential
Claims exist. A Member or Guest who cannot obtain clearance to reveal an Essential Claim
shall notify the Technology Committee Chair that s/he will cease to participate in discussion
of, and withdraw from all Ballots concerning, the proposed document.

9.1.5. Inquiry to Possible Patent Holders

Following notice of possible Essential Claims, the Director of Engineering shall perform a
Patent Inquiry, requesting the reported owner of the intellectual property in question to
complete a SMPTE Patent Statement if the owner considers that it does own or control
patents or pending applications likely to include Essential Claims for implementation or use of
the Engineering Document. The Patent Statement, in a form approved by the Standards
Committee, shall identify whether licensing of any Essential Claims would be available under
RAND terms.

If no reply is received within 30 days, the Director of Engineering shall repeat the Patent
Inquiry. If no reply is received within a further 30 days, the Director of Engineering shall
report this to the Technology Committee and no further correspondence with the entity shall
be required.

9.1.6. Conduct of Ballots, Votes and Audits with Associated IP Statements

When an Engineering Document is Balloted for elevation to FCD, the Director of Engineering
shall issue, in conjunction with the Ballot notification, a “Call for Patents” in a form approved
by the Standards Committee. The FCD Ballot shall reference any Patent Statements already
submitted with respect to the proposed Engineering Document. If a notice of possible
Essential Claims has been made as described in section 9.1.4, and if the Director of
Engineering has not received an affirmative response to the Patent Inquiry described in
section 9.1.5, then the Director of Engineering shall post a Comment against the FCD Ballot
regarding the outstanding Patent Inquiry.

Receipt of a statement in response to a Patent Inquiry shall be noted as a Comment
response and shall resolve the Comment unless the Patent Statement indicates that
Essential Claims exist and that there is no RAND assurance. If any entity provides a
completed Patent Statement that indicates Essential Claims exist and that there is no RAND
assurance, the Technology Committee may either revise the Engineering Document to
exclude the protected technology or terminate work on the Engineering Document. If the
Technology Committee considers that the completed Patent Statement may be frivolous or
invalid it may choose to seek the direction of the Standards Committee. If any entity has
failed to respond to a Patent Inquiry and there is no suitable alternative technology, these
facts shall be noted as a Comment response, and the Technology Committee may choose to
retain the technology in question by conducting a Disposition Vote on the Comment.

All relevant Patent Statements, Patent Inquiries, and Disposition Votes shall be part of the
Standards Committee Audit.

9.1.7. Patent Statement in Published Documents

All published Engineering Documents shall include an appropriate statement, in a form
approved by the Standards Committee; calling attention to the possibility that implementation
of the Engineering Document may require the use of Essential Claims.

9.1.8. Transfers of Essential Claims

(a) Each party submitting a Patent Statement shall agree that it will not transfer, and confirm
that it has not transferred, ownership in patents or patent applications having Essential
Claims for the purpose of circumventing such party’s obligations under this Policy.

(b) Licensing undertakings made pursuant to this Policy shall be interpreted as
encumbrances that bind all successors-in-interest. Recognizing that this interpretation may
not be enforceable in all legal jurisdictions, any party who has submitted a licensing
undertaking according to this Policy who transfers ownership of any patent or patent
application having Essential Claims subject to such undertaking shall include appropriate
provisions in the relevant transfer documents to ensure that the undertaking is binding on the
transferee and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
future transfers with the goal of binding all successors-in-interest. The undertaking shall be
interpreted as binding on successors-in-interest regardless of whether such provisions are
included in the relevant transfer documents.

9.1.9. Essential Claims Revealed After Publication

In the event that an Essential Claim is first revealed by a Member or Guest following adoption
and publication of a Engineering Document, the owner or controller of the Essential Claim
shall be asked to make a licensing commitment to the Essential Claim in the same manner as
if it related to technology proposed for adoption by such Member or Guest during the
development of the Engineering Document in question. If such request is refused, the
Engineering Document in question shall be referred back to the relevant Technology
Committee for consideration and possible action.

9.1.10. Irrevocability and Binding Nature of Commitments

All commitments made under this Policy shall be irrevocable, except that the owner of an
Essential Claim may include a “reciprocity” or “defensive suspension” term in a license to its
Essential Claims. For purposes of this policy, (a) reciprocity shall mean that a licensor may
require a licensee to provide a reciprocal RAND license with respect to any Essential
Claim(s) owned by the licensee with respect to the same Engineering Document, and (b)
defensive suspension shall mean that a licensor may revoke a license granted to an
implementer if that implementer asserts an Essential Claim (other than under RAND license
terms) in connection with the same Engineering Document against the licensor or its
Affiliates.

An Affiliate of a party shall mean a company or other legal entity which now or, hereafter,
controls or is controlled by or is under common control with such party, but any such
company or other legal entity shall be deemed to be an Affiliate only as long as such control
exists, and for the purposes of this definition, “control” shall mean direct or indirect ownership
of more than 50% of the voting power, capital or other securities of the controlled or
commonly controlled entity.

9.1.11. Third Party Beneficiaries

In the event that any party brings an infringement action against an implementer of an
Engineering Document relating to an Essential Claim(s) under such document with respect to
which such Essential Claim owner is under a licensing obligation under this Policy, SMPTE
shall have no obligation to intervene, but such implementer shall be entitled to assert that it is
a third party beneficiary under such licensing obligation.

9.1.12. Survival of Obligations

(a) Any disclosure or other obligation that any Member or Guest incurs under this Policy shall
continue in force after the Member ceases to be a Member, or the Guest ceases to be a
participant, for any reason. However, no Member or Guest shall become subject to any new
obligation under this Policy after ceasing to be a Member or Guest.

(b) Any licensing obligation incurred by any party under this policy shall continue in force until
the expiration of all Patents that include Essential Claims and shall be binding upon
successors of ownership and control as specified in 9.1.8.

(c) All persons and entities that are intended third party beneficiaries of rights and obligations
incurred under this Policy shall remain entitled to enforce the same, notwithstanding any
termination, dissolution or winding up of SMPTE.
